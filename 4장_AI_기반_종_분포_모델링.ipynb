        "### What is Species Distribution Modeling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Species Distribution Modeling (SDM below) is the most common methodology used to estimate the actual or potential geographic distribution of a species. It involves characterizing the environmental conditions suitable for a particular species and then identifying where these suitable conditions are distributed geographically.\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM has emerged as a crucial component of conservation planning in recent years, and various modeling techniques have been developed for this purpose. Implementing SDM in Google Earth Engine (GEE below) provides easy access to large-scale environmental data, along with powerful computing capabilities and support for machine learning algorithms, allowing for rapid modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Note: Conservation biologist Dr. Ramiro D. Crego implemented SDM using the GEE JavaScript Code Editor and published his research findings [(Crego et al, 2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.13491). The methodology of SDM introduced here has been translated and modified from the [JavaScript source code](https://smithsonian.github.io/SDMinGEE/) he shared into the Python language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Required for SDM\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM typically utilizes the relationship between known species occurrence records and environmental variables to identify the conditions under which a population can sustain. In other words, two types of model input data are required:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Occurrence records of known species\n",
        "1. Various environmental variables\n",
        "\n",
        "These data are input into algorithms to identify environmental conditions associated with the presence of species.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow of SDM using GEE\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow for SDM using GEE is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Collection and preprocessing of species occurrence data\n",
        "1. Definition of the Area of Interest\n",
        "1. Addition of GEE environmental variables\n",

Here, the background data does not necessarily mean areas where the species does not exist but rather is set up to reflect the overall environmental conditions of the study area. It is used to distinguish suitable environments where the species could exist from less suitable ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Presence-Absence Method**: This method compares locations where the species has been observed (presence) with locations where it has definitively not been observed (absence). Here, absence data represents specific locations where the species is known not to exist. It does not reflect the overall environmental conditions of the study area but rather points to locations where the species is estimated not to exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, it is often difficult to collect true absence data, so pseudo-absence data generated artificially is frequently used. However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations and potential errors of this method, as artificially generated pseudo-absence points may not accurately reflect true absence areas.\n",

        "The choice between these two methods depends on data availability, research objectives, model accuracy and reliability, as well as time and resources.

Environmental Classification Using k-means Clustering: The k-means clustering algorithm, based on Euclidean distance, will be used to divide the pixels within the study area into two clusters.

        "\n",
        "2. Generation of Pseudo-Absence Data within Dissimilar Clusters: Within the second cluster identified in the first step (which has different environmental characteristics from the presence data), randomly generated pseudo-absence points will be created.

        "We will now divide the data into training data and test data. The training data will be used to find the optimal parameters by training the model, while the test data will be used to evaluate the model trained beforehand. An important concept to consider in this context is spatial autocorrelation.\n",

It embodies the concept that \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things\". Spatial autocorrelation represents the significant relationship between the location of species and environmental variables. However, if spatial autocorrelation exists between the training and test data, the independence between the two data sets can be compromised. This significantly impacts the evaluation of the model's generalization ability.\n",

This technique involves dividing the data into multiple blocks, using each block independently as training and test datasets to reduce the impact of spatial autocorrelation. This enhances the independence between datasets, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the model's generalization ability.\n",

        "3. Iterative cross-validation: The entire process is repeated n times (e.g., 10 times). In each iteration, the blocks are randomly divided into training and test sets again, which is intended to improve the model's stability and reliability.\n",
