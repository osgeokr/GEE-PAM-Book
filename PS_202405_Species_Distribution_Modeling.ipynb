        "### What is Species Distribution Modeling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Species Distribution Modeling (SDM below) is the most common methodology used to estimate the actual or potential geographic distribution of a species. It involves characterizing the environmental conditions suitable for a particular species and then identifying where these suitable conditions are distributed geographically.\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM has emerged as a crucial component of conservation planning in recent years, and various modeling techniques have been developed for this purpose. Implementing SDM in Google Earth Engine (GEE below) provides easy access to large-scale environmental data, along with powerful computing capabilities and support for machine learning algorithms, allowing for rapid modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Note: Conservation biologist Dr. Ramiro D. Crego implemented SDM using the GEE JavaScript Code Editor and published his research findings [(Crego et al, 2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.13491). The methodology of SDM introduced here has been translated and modified from the [JavaScript source code](https://smithsonian.github.io/SDMinGEE/) he shared into the Python language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Required for SDM\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM typically utilizes the relationship between known species occurrence records and environmental variables to identify the conditions under which a population can sustain. In other words, two types of model input data are required:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Occurrence records of known species\n",
        "1. Various environmental variables\n",
        "\n",
        "These data are input into algorithms to identify environmental conditions associated with the presence of species.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow of SDM using GEE\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow for SDM using GEE is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Collection and preprocessing of species occurrence data\n",
        "1. Definition of the Area of Interest\n",
        "1. Addition of GEE environmental variables\n",
        "1. Generation of pseudo-absence data\n",

The use of a heatmap allows us to quickly grasp the frequency of species occurrence by year and month, providing an intuitive visualization of the temporal changes and patterns within the data. This allows for the identification of temporal patterns and seasonal variations in species occurrence data, as well as the rapid detection of outliers or quality issues within the data."

It is used to distinguish suitable environments where the species could exist from less suitable ones.\n",

        "We will now divide the data into training data and test data. The training data will be used to find the optimal parameters by training the model, while the test data will be used to evaluate the model trained beforehand. An important concept to consider in this context is spatial autocorrelation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Spatial autocorrelation** is an essential element in SDM, associated with Tobler's law. It embodies the concept that \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things\". Spatial autocorrelation represents the significant relationship between the location of species and environmental variables. However, if spatial autocorrelation exists between the training and test data, the independence between the two data sets can be compromised. This significantly impacts the evaluation of the model's generalization ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "One method to address this issue is the spatial block cross-validation technique, which involves dividing the data into training and testing datasets. This technique involves dividing the data into multiple blocks, using each block independently as training and test datasets to reduce the impact of spatial autocorrelation. This enhances the independence between datasets, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the model's generalization ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The specific procedure is as follows:\n",
        "1. Creation of spatial blocks: Divide the entire dataset into spatial blocks of equal size (e.g., 50x50 km).\n",
        "2. Assignment of training and testing sets: Each spatial block is randomly assigned to either the training set (70%) or the test set (30%). This prevents the model from overfitting to data from specific areas and aims to achieve more generalized results.\n",
        "3. Iterative cross-validation: The entire process is repeated n times (e.g., 10 times). In each iteration, the blocks are randomly divided into training and test sets again, which is intended to improve the model's stability and reliability.\n",
        "4. Generation of pseudo-absence data: In each iteration, pseudo-absence data are randomly generated to evaluate the model's performance."

The final number of points may vary due to the random partitioning of spatial blocks, so it's crucial to verify if there are enough presence and pseudo-absence points for model validation. In the case of endangered or rare species, there might be a shortage of occurrence data, leading to an insufficient test dataset. In such cases, alternatives may include additional data collection based on expert knowledge and experience or utilizing relevant alternative data sources."
