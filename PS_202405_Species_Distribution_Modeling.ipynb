        "### What is Species Distribution Modeling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Species Distribution Modeling (SDM below) is the most common methodology used to estimate the actual or potential geographic distribution of a species. It involves characterizing the environmental conditions suitable for a particular species and then identifying where these suitable conditions are distributed geographically.\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM has emerged as a crucial component of conservation planning in recent years, and various modeling techniques have been developed for this purpose. Implementing SDM in Google Earth Engine (GEE below) provides easy access to large-scale environmental data, along with powerful computing capabilities and support for machine learning algorithms, allowing for rapid modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Note: Conservation biologist Dr. Ramiro D. Crego implemented SDM using the GEE JavaScript Code Editor and published his research findings [(Crego et al, 2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.13491). The methodology of SDM introduced here has been translated and modified from the [JavaScript source code](https://smithsonian.github.io/SDMinGEE/) he shared into the Python language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Required for SDM\n",
        "\n",
        "SDM typically utilizes the relationship between known species occurrence records and environmental variables to identify the conditions under which a population can sustain. In other words, two types of model input data are required:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Occurrence records of known species\n",
        "1. Various environmental variables\n",
        "\n",
        "These data are input into algorithms to identify environmental conditions associated with the presence of species.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow of SDM using GEE\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow for SDM using GEE is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Collection and preprocessing of species occurrence data\n",
        "1. Definition of the Area of Interest\n",
        "1. Addition of GEE environmental variables\n",
        "1. Generation of pseudo-absence data\n",

The use of a heatmap allows us to quickly grasp the frequency of species occurrence by year and month, providing an intuitive visualization of the temporal changes and patterns within the data. This allows for the identification of temporal patterns and seasonal variations in species occurrence data, as well as the rapid detection of outliers or quality issues within the data."

        "\n",
        "In the process of SDM, the selection of input data for a species is mainly approached using two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Presence-Background Method**: This method compares the locations where a particular species has been observed (presence) with other locations where the species has not been observed (background). Here, the background data does not necessarily mean areas where the species does not exist but rather is set up to reflect the overall environmental conditions of the study area. It is used to distinguish suitable environments where the species could exist from less suitable ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Presence-Absence Method**: This method compares locations where the species has been observed (presence) with locations where it has definitively not been observed (absence). Here, absence data represents specific locations where the species is known not to exist. It does not reflect the overall environmental conditions of the study area but rather points to locations where the species is estimated not to exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, it is often difficult to collect true absence data, so pseudo-absence data generated artificially is frequently used. However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations and potential errors of this method, as artificially generated pseudo-absence points may not accurately reflect true absence areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice between these two methods depends on data availability, research objectives, model accuracy and reliability, as well as time and resources. Here, we will use occurrence data collected from GBIF and artificially generated pseudo-absence data to model using the \"Presence-Absence\" method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The generation of pseudo-absence data will be done through the \"environmental profiling approach\", and the specific steps are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Environmental Classification Using k-means Clustering: The k-means clustering algorithm, based on Euclidean distance, will be used to divide the pixels within the study area into two clusters. One cluster will represent areas with similar environmental characteristics to randomly selected 100 presence locations, while the other cluster will represent areas with different characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.

        "We will now divide the data into training data and test data. The training data will be used to find the optimal parameters by training the model, while the test data will be used to evaluate the model trained beforehand. An important concept to consider in this context is spatial autocorrelation.\n",

        "**Spatial autocorrelation** is an essential element in SDM, associated with Tobler's law. It embodies the concept that \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things\". Spatial autocorrelation represents the significant relationship between the location of species and environmental variables. However, if spatial autocorrelation exists between the training and test data, the independence between the two data sets can be compromised. This significantly impacts the evaluation of the model's generalization ability.\n",

        "One method to address this issue is the spatial block cross-validation technique, which involves dividing the data into training and testing datasets. This technique involves dividing the data into multiple blocks, using each block independently as training and test datasets to reduce the impact of spatial autocorrelation. This enhances the independence between datasets, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the model's generalization ability.\n",

        "1. Creation of spatial blocks: Divide the entire dataset into spatial blocks of equal size (e.g., 50x50 km).\n",
        "2. Assignment of training and testing sets: Each spatial block is randomly assigned to either the training set (70%) or the test set (30%). This prevents the model from overfitting to data from specific areas and aims to achieve more generalized results.\n",
        "3. Iterative cross-validation: The entire process is repeated n times (e.g., 10 times). In each iteration, the blocks are randomly divided into training and test sets again, which is intended to improve the model's stability and reliability.\n",
